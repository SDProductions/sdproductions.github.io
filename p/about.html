        <p>SDProductions was created in 2018 to facilitate the creation of quality software for quality people - quality people just like you. SDBagel, the sole proprietor, owner, and the only member of SDProductions, works on projects in his free time primarily for fun, as well as to build a portfolio of cool stuff to show off to people. He considers himself to be good enough at C# to make some cool stuff, and takes an interest in .NET Core including its ASP flavor. Currently, he enjoys working on web and design related projects. He also finds talking in the third person very awkward, but doesn't really know how else to phrase this paragraph since it's the organization page.</p>
