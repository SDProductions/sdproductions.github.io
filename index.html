      <h1>Trackr Desktop</h1>
      <p>Trackr is the premiere off-brand choice for time management needs! The Trackr Desktop client never connects to the internet so the personal data you enter in stays secure. The interface is designed such that all features and information can be quickly seen and accessed from the initial launch screen, ensuring less time learning how to use Trackr and more time saved managing your schedule. You can even export your data for analysis in a third party tool!</p>

      <h1>Cynobroad</h1>
      <p>Cynobroad is a WIP application built on the WinForms platform that allows users to chat through a client/server architecture with self-hosted servers. Many features are incomplete or unstable at the moment. Serverless LAN-based chat through UDP still needs to be implemented, integrating the server directly into the chat client for ease of use, as well as some other improvements need to be done. Help us improve it by taking a look at the GitHub repo below.</p>

      <h1>Webventures</h1>
      <p>Aside from Trackr and Cynobroad, there are no other traditional desktop apps we are working on at the moment, although we do have some planned. The rest of our projects are website based, and include this website, as well as Multispatial Logistics Services based on ASP.NET Core 2.1 MVC. MSLS is a website that will provide EVE Online (All Rights Reserved to CCP Games, hf) related services and is currently WIP. You can find the our GitHub organization page below, where you can find most projects we are working on.</p>
